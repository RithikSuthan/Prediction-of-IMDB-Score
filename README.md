## Overview
The IMDB Score Prediction project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to the success of movies, as indicated by their IMDB scores. By understanding these factors, we can provide insights to film companies on how to create commercially successful movies.

## Aim
Based on a vast dataset of movie information, we seek to determine the important factors that make a movie more successful than others, i.e., achieve a higher IMDB score. Through analysis and visualization using ggplot2 in R, we aim to identify trends and patterns that contribute to a movie's success.

## Procedure
1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset and relevant R libraries.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and recode the data using various techniques to ensure its suitability for analysis.
3. **Descriptive Statistics:** Provide data visualizations of descriptive statistics to gain insights into the characteristics of the dataset.
4. **Model Fitting:** Fit models using statistical classification methods commonly used in churn analysis, such as decision tree analysis, random forest analysis, and logistic regression.
5. **Visualization of Results:** Examine additional data visualizations of selected variables based on our modeling techniques to further understand the factors influencing IMDB scores.

## Methodology
- **Decision Tree Analysis:** Utilize decision tree analysis to identify the most significant variables contributing to a movie's IMDB score.
- **Random Forest Analysis:** Employ random forest analysis to assess the importance of various features in predicting IMDB scores.
- **Logistic Regression:** Apply logistic regression to model the relationship between predictor variables and the likelihood of achieving a high IMDB score.

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Install the required R libraries specified in the project documentation.
- Load the dataset and execute the R scripts provided in the project directory to perform data preprocessing, model fitting, and visualization.

## Results
The results of the analysis will be presented through visualizations and insights derived from the modeling techniques employed. These insights will help film companies understand the factors that contribute to the success of movies and guide them in making informed decisions to create commercially successful movies.
